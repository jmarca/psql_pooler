Simple bit of code extracted from another repo to create a
long-running pool
using [node-postgres](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres).  I
found I was including that other repo and using this code a lot so I
pulled it into its own repo


To test, create a file called test.config.json (and make sure it is
excluded from git)
